# Time-Series-Forcast-Superstore-Sales

A time series is a sequence of observations recorded at regular time intervals. Depending on the frequency of observations, a time series may typically be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual.

Time series forecasting is basically machine learning modeling for Time Series data (years, days, hoursâ€¦etc.)for predicting future values using Time Series modeling.

In this case study, time is the independent variable, while the dependent variable is Sales data of a superstore.

Using ARIMA and SARIMA time series models, I forecasted the future sales of a superstore by leveraging historical data spanning four years, from 2015 to 2018.
